# ARWatches
This is a Unity application that takes an image target that you can put on your wrist that allows you to have a watch model on top of it. The app will also allow users to make changes the watch to fit them (Ex: Switching watch models, change colors, etc.)

*Inspiration and watch models/UI images from Parth Anand (LinkedIn Learning)*
